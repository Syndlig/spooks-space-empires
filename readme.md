## FAQ
- Are the required mods actually required?
  - Some yes, some no. You will require <INSERT> and <MODHERE> due to my empires using flags from those icon packs. If you want to use the machine empires, they all use <MACHINE SHIPS> and will not appear without it installed, though the mod will still implement the other empires just fine without it. You *do*, however, need <Planetary Modifiers>, as the overwhelming majority of empires use the planets provided by that mod!

## Compatibility
Should be compatible with any other mods, as this simply adds custom empires! There's one set of name lists created for this mod, but should not conflict with anything.
